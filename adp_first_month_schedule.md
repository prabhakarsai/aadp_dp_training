## Schedule for AADP - Month 1

The schedule consists of a topic list with the approximate effort in hours for an average-paced learner in brackets.

### Fundamentals of Design & Architecture Patterns + UML 

   1. What are Patterns in Software ? (5) 
   1. Describing a Pattern - Context, Problem & Solution (3)
   1. How Design Patterns Simplify Problem Solving (3)
   1. Pattern Categories  (2)
   1. Basics of UML - Types of Diagrams, Class Diagram (5)

TOTAL HOURS (approx): 18

### Basics of Object Oriented Design Patterns

   1. G4 Design Patterns Catalog (2)
   1. Creational Patterns
      1. Abstract Factory & Factory Method (5)
      1. Builder  (5)
      1. Prototype (5)
      1. Singleton (3)

TOTAL HOURS (approx): 20

### Expressing OO design with UML Diagrams

   1. Main Diagram Classes (8)
      1. Class / Interface
      1. Use-case
      1. Sequence
      1. State
      1. Activity
   1. Examples (12)

TOTAL HOURS (approx): (20)

### Suggested Problems & Examples

   1. Implement a generic Singleton class in Python using,
      * Overriding ____new____ and ____call____
      * Using meta-classes

   Other classes should be able to derive from the Singleton and make themselves Singletons.
   1. Implement __AbstractFactory__ factory in Python to solve the problem of building different models of cars in a Suzuki factory floor.
   1. Implement the __Builder__ pattern in Python to solve the problem of building laptops by assembling components of the laptop. Combine with AbstractFactory to write a program that given different toshiba model laptops names as inputs, will build and return them.
   1. Implement the _parametrized Singleton_ pattern in Python. A parametrized singleton is a modified Singleton pattern that returns the same object given the same argument in the constructor (Advanced). 
   1. Create a UML class diagram for a Vehicle class with sub-classes Car, Truck, MotorCycle and BiCycle. Try and implement the class hierarchy in Python if possible.
   1. Create a UML sequence diagram for what you think is the sequence of actions when you perform an online e-commerce (shopping) transaction. 
   1. Create a UML use-case & activity diagram for a book library lending transaction.
  
For creating diagrams, GNU dia [7] can be used.

#### Suggested Schedule

The approximate hours of work for the first month is 55-60. It is suggested to spend an hour per day on week-days and 10 hours in the week-ends, for an average of 15 hours per week. It may not be a good idea to keep all the reading & study towards the week-ends only.
